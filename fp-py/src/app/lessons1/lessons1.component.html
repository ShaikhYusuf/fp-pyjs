    <h2>Lesson 1. What is Functional Programming?</h2>
    <h6>
      <strong>Functional Programming (FP)</strong> is a programming paradigm that focuses on writing software by defining and applying functions, without changing states or mutable data. Unlike other programming paradigms, FP avoids altering the program's data, promoting the use of functions to solve problems.

      <strong>Key Characteristics of FP:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functions</strong> are the primary building blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Once a variable or data structure is created, it cannot be changed.</li>
        <li><strong>Pure functions</strong>: Functions return the same output when given the same input and do not cause side effects.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>2. Functional Programming Principles and Advantages</h2>
    
    <h3>Principles:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pure Functions</strong>: The output of a function depends only on its input and does not cause any observable side effects (like modifying a variable outside the function).</li>
      <li><strong>First-class Functions</strong>: Functions can be passed around as values, just like other types (e.g., numbers, strings).</li>
      <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Data cannot be changed after it’s created. Instead, new data is created from the existing data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Predictable</strong>: Pure functions always return the same result for the same input, making your code more predictable.</li>
      <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Because functions are isolated and don’t rely on external state, they can be reused in many different places.</li>
      <li><strong>Easier Debugging</strong>: Since there are no side effects, you don’t have to track down changes in the program’s state.</li>
      <li><strong>Testability</strong>: Pure functions are easier to test because you don't have to worry about external influences affecting the result.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Comparing Functional Programming with Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript and Python</h2>
    
    <h3>Imperative Programming:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on <strong>how</strong> to do something, with step-by-step instructions.</li>
      <li>Uses <strong>mutable</strong> state and control structures like loops (e.g., for, while).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on organizing code around objects and classes.</li>
      <li>Encourages <strong>mutating</strong> data, which is stored in objects, and using methods to modify that data.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Functional Programming:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on <strong>what</strong> needs to be done rather than <strong>how</strong>.</li>
      <li>Uses <strong>pure functions</strong> and avoids changing state (immutable data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Functional Programming Paradigms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pure Functions</strong>: Functions that produce no side effects and return the same result for the same input.</li>
      <li><strong>First-class and Higher-order Functions</strong>: Functions that can be passed around as arguments or returned as results from other functions.</li>
      <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Data structures are immutable, meaning once they are created, they cannot be modified.</li>
      <li><strong>Recursion</strong>: Instead of using loops, FP uses recursion to iterate or repeat tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Example of a Pure Function</h2>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
        function add(a, b) {{'{'}}
          return a + b;
        {{'}'}}
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>Pure functions always return the same output for the same input.</p>
